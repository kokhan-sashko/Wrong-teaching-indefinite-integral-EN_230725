# Wrong-teaching-indefinite-integral-EN_230725
The repository contains an article about the incorrect teaching of "indefinite_integral" in leading textbooks of many countries. The repository is published to record copyrights and for joint public work with readers to record, recognize and correct this most unpleasant error in the educational system of many countries. 
   This repository contains only one file for you. It is simply saved in different formats for different users and for different purposes. And in different languages that need to be viewed in separate folders with the language name. Well, there are also versions by dates - the later the date, the better the file (we added something meaningful there)
 
# Falsche Lehre - unbestimmtes Integral-GERM_050825 
Das Repository enthält einen Artikel über die fehlerhafte Lehre des „unbestimmten Integrals“ in führenden Lehrbüchern vieler Länder. Das Repository dient der Dokumentation von Urheberrechten und der gemeinsamen öffentlichen Arbeit mit Lesern, um diesen äußerst unangenehmen Fehler im Bildungssystem vieler Länder zu erfassen, zu erkennen und zu korrigieren.

Dieses Repository enthält nur eine Datei für Sie. Sie wird lediglich in verschiedenen Formaten für verschiedene Benutzer und Zwecke gespeichert. Und in verschiedenen Sprachen, die in separaten Ordnern mit dem jeweiligen Sprachnamen angezeigt werden müssen. Es gibt auch Versionen nach Datum – je später das Datum, desto besser die Datei (wir haben dort etwas Sinnvolles hinzugefügt).

Warning! You can understand the gist of this article even without any understanding of mathematics, just skip the mathematical constructions. Discussions with gpt chat in this case you can just read the last 25%.
Imagine a world where the very foundations  of science, taught in prestigious universities for over two centuries, are built on fundamental errors. This compelling article exposes a shocking educational tragedy, particularly in the realm of mathematics, that has silently crippled generations of bright minds and severely impacted national development. 
At its core lies the unassuming "indefinite integral"—a concept critical for engineers and scientists, yet often taught with a "duality in definitions" so absurd it renders 99% of its practical applications invalid. The authors, drawing on decades of personal struggle and research, reveal how this "unnoticed error collapses education," driving talented students away from STEM fields as they grapple with contradictory teachings. 
But the problem isn't just academic; it's deeply human. Discover why confronting this truth unleashes a "universal educational tragedy" that challenges the self-respect of accomplished professionals and forces educators to grapple with a lifetime of unknowingly perpetuating flawed knowledge. The article also unveils the unexpected role of artificial intelligence as a potential ally in this battle for intellectual honesty. 
This isn't merely a critique; it's an urgent "open appeal and call" to governments, educational bodies, and concerned citizens worldwide to correct these "terribly consequential errors" and liberate future generations from "absurd, foolish, meaningless torment" in learning. Will the long-standing "resistance to truth" finally yield to reason, or will the "crippling of minds and destinies" continue unnoticed? 
Dive into this article to uncover a hidden crisis that impacts us all and learn what it truly takes to mend the broken foundations of modern education. 

The article also includes examples of real dialogues with artificial intelligence, where the artificial intelligence first naively tries to relay generally accepted definitions. Then it tries to wriggle out of it several times with academic fog, and then finally admits that the definition is absolutely wrong.
